# Usage

Turn the indexed panel into decisions with a clear setup, focused comparisons, and repeatable checks.

What to look for:

* **Leader & laggard:** Highest vs. lowest line since base; persistent spread = durable trend.
* **Base recapture/failure:** Crosses of 100 often mark regime turns; confirm with breadth/vol.
* **Risk posture:** QQQ/SPY vs. TLT/T-Bills—if risk outruns safety, the tape favors beta.
* **USD effect:** DXY vs. ACWI/GLD—rising dollar + weak ACWI can pressure global risk.
* **Crypto beta:** BTC/ETH vs. QQQ—outperformance signals higher-beta appetite.
* **Liquidity lens:** Overlay US M2 to see whether leadership aligns with liquidity expansion.
