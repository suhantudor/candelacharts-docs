# Major Assets

A single starting line can turn messy markets into a readable race. By indexing multiple assets to **100** from the same date, **CandelaCharts – Major Assets** shows who’s leading, who’s lagging, and how gaps evolve across time. This solves the apples-to-oranges problem that plagues raw price charts: everything is on the same scale, so relative performance is obvious.

Pick an anchor date that matters to your process—cycle low/high, a central bank pivot, year-to-date start, or your portfolio inception—and the indicator rebases each series from that point. The result is a clean, cross-asset lens spanning equities, bonds, cash, commodities, the US dollar, crypto, and even a macro context line (US M2). End-of-series labels reduce eye travel: you can read the leaderboard directly at the right edge.

Use it to validate narratives (e.g., “tech leads while defensives lag”), monitor regime shifts (recaptures of the base line), or create client-friendly charts where the story is self-evident without extra annotation.
