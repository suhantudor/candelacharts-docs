Bitcoin Dominance is a key market metric that measures Bitcoinâ€™s market capitalization relative to the entire cryptocurrency market.&#x20;

This indicator plots:

* **Daily BTC.D close values**
* **Trend-moving averages (MA)** for dominance tracking
* **Dynamic bullish/bearish color shifts** based on trend alignment
* **Critical dominance levels (40%, 50%, 65%)** with background highlighting

Traders can use it to gauge whether Bitcoin is outperforming or underperforming altcoins, assisting in portfolio allocation and market timing decisions.
