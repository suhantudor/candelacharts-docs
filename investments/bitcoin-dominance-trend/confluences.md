# Confluences

For deeper insights, combine **BTC Dominance Trend** with the following market cap indices:

* **TOTAL2 (Altcoin Market Cap excluding BTC)**
  * BTC.D rising while TOTAL2 is falling → Bitcoin strength at the expense of altcoins.
  * BTC.D falling while TOTAL2 is rising → Altcoins outperforming, risk-on sentiment.
* **TOTAL3 (Altcoin Market Cap excluding BTC and ETH)**
  * BTC.D rising while TOTAL3 is falling → Strong Bitcoin + ETH dominance, small caps underperform.
  * BTC.D falling while TOTAL3 is rising → Strong rotation into mid/small-cap altcoins, often peak altseason behavior.

By analyzing BTC.D together with TOTAL2 and TOTAL3, traders can clearly see **where capital is flowing** in the crypto market: into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or the wider altcoin ecosystem.
