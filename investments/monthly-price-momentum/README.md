# Monthly Price Momentum

Speed and direction tell the real story—monthly momentum shows whether the market is merely drifting or genuinely surging.&#x20;

**CandelaCharts – Monthly Price Momentum** measures **ROC% over \~30 days**, smooths it for readability, and overlays a **0 line** and an **upper threshold** so you can spot regime shifts, euphoric thrusts, and capitulation periods at a glance.
