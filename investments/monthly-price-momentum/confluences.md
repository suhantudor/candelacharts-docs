# Confluences

Pair monthly momentum with structure and risk context for stronger signals.

* **Trend MAs:** 50/200-day slope to align with the dominant flow.
* **Volatility:** ATR/VIXâ€”extremes under rising vol unwind faster.
* **Market structure:** Use SR levels or breakout bases for execution.
* **Breadth/RS:** Confirm strength with breadth or relative-performance ranks.
