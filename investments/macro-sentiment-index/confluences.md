# Confluences

The Macro Sentiment Index doesn’t work best in isolation. Its real value emerges when used alongside price action and other market signals to confirm or challenge the prevailing narrative.

Because MSI is built on **daily closes** of underlying instruments (many of which are slow-moving macro indicators), it updates once per bar and is best interpreted on **daily or weekly charts**. This makes it a **coincident** rather than a leading indicator — it reflects _what is already happening_ across markets, not what might happen next. That means timing entries based solely on MSI turns can be misleading.

Instead, its strength lies in identifying **regime shifts**, filtering out noise, and validating whether momentum aligns with broader risk dynamics.

### **1. Price Trend Alignment**

MSI should move in the same direction as price during healthy trends.

* ✅ **Bullish confirmation**: Price in SPY makes higher highs while MSI holds above 0 and remains stable or rising.
* ⚠️ **Divergence warning**: Price reaches new highs but MSI trends lower — suggests weakening breadth or risk appetite. Common before corrections.
* ❌ **Bearish regime**: Price below key moving averages _and_ MSI below 0 — avoid countertrend longs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Example: In late 2022, as SPY rebounded from lows, MSI remained below zero for weeks — a sign the rally lacked broad risk support. Many early longs were shaken out when volatility returned in 2023 Q1.
{% endhint %}

### **2. Volatility Context**

MSI and volatility instruments often move together, but their relationship changes over time.

* When **VIX is low and falling** but **MSI is rising**: Confidence is growing — supports trend continuation.
* When **VIX spikes** and **MSI drops sharply**: Systemic stress — often seen during Fed surprises or geopolitical shocks.
* Watch **VVIX** and **MOVE**: If both rise while MSI falls, expect extended chop or drawdown.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: MSI reacts _after_ volatility shocks. It won't predict a 5-sigma event — but it will confirm when risk-off conditions have taken hold.
{% endhint %}

### **3. Yield Curve & Liquidity Signals**

Fixed income trends often lead equity sentiment.

* If **10Y–2Y spread (TYX)** is flattening/inverting _and_ **MSI is declining**: Risk-off build-up in progress. Be cautious on growth assets.
* If **TED Spread** or **MOVE Index** rises while MSI falls: Banking or bond market stress, not just equity fear.
* When **SOFR/ED futures** shift expectations of rate cuts _before_ MSI turns up: Early signal of coming risk-on rotation.

{% hint style="success" %}
Real-world use: In Q4 2023, rising SOFR futures (betting on cuts) preceded the MSI recovery by 2–3 weeks — an early clue that positioning was shifting.
{% endhint %}

### **4. Credit Markets**

High-yield spreads and ETFs like HYG and LQD are sensitive to risk appetite.

* **HYG/LQD ratio rising + MSI rising**: Strong risk-on, solid credit demand.
* **HYG/LQD falling while MSI flat or down**: Credit markets turning cautious before equities.

This confluence helped spot early stress ahead of the March 2023 regional banking turmoil, when HYG sold off while SPY held up.

### **5. Sector Rotation**

Defensive vs. cyclical sector flows often align with MSI.

* **XLU/XLY ratio rising** while **MSI falls**: Investors rotate into utilities — defensive behavior confirmed.
* **XLY/XLP ratio falling** under **negative MSI**: Consumer staples outperform, signaling risk aversion.

These ratios don’t always move in sync with MSI, but persistent alignment increases confidence in the regime call.

### **6. Commodity & Global Growth Proxies**

* **Copper/Gold ratio rising** + **BDIY up** + **MSI positive**: Global growth optimism.
* **Oil spikes but MSI falls**: Not demand-driven — likely geopolitical; tread carefully.

Copper, in particular, has shown strong correlation with MSI over multi-month periods — both reflect industrial and speculative demand.

### **7. Macro Data Releases**

MSI rarely jumps on a single print — but structural shifts emerge after repeated data surprises.

* Three consecutive hotter CPI prints → Fed expectations shift → SOFR futures adjust → ED futures price in fewer cuts → MSI begins to fall
* This process takes **weeks**, not days

So while MSI won’t spike on NFP day, it _will_ reflect the cumulative impact of tightening policy expectations over time.

### **When Confluences Fail**

* **Short-term noise**: On intraday charts, MSI appears “lagging” — because it is. It’s not designed for scalping.
* **Asset-specific moves**: A tech blowoff in QQQ can lift MSI temporarily, even if macro conditions are deteriorating.
* **Flash crashes**: VIX spikes, but other inputs don’t confirm — MSI may not drop immediately.

{% hint style="success" %}
Key insight: **MSI filters the noise, but only after the fact.** That’s okay — its job is not to catch the first tick of a move, but to tell you whether you’re trading _with_ or _against_ the macro wind.
{% endhint %}

### **Bottom Line**

Use MSI to answer one question: **"Are broader financial conditions supportive of risk-taking — or working against it?"**

Then apply confluences not as mechanical triggers, but as **triangulation tools**:

* Is price action matching the sentiment signal?
* Are credit, volatility, yields, and commodities telling the same story?
* Has the shift been confirmed across multiple days?

When multiple independent signals align — especially in direction and timing — the probability of a sustained move increases.

MSI won’t tell you _when_ to enter. But it can help you decide _whether_ to act at all. And in macro trading, that’s often enough.
