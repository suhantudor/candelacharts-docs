The **Macro Sentiment Index (MSI)** is a comprehensive, multi-asset indicator that synthesizes global financial market sentiment into a single, actionable metric. By aggregating and normalizing data from equities, bonds, commodities, currencies, volatility indices, and macroeconomic proxies, MSI provides traders and investors with a real-time pulse of risk appetite across markets.

The final composite score oscillates around zero:

* **Above 0**: Dominant risk-on sentiment
* **Below 0**: Growing risk aversion or defensive positioning
* **Beyond ±1**: Extreme regimes, often associated with market tops or stress events

A smoothing option (SMA, EMA, RMA, VWMA) allows users to filter noise, while visual modes (columns, histogram, area, line) enable flexible chart integration. The index also includes automatic correlation monitoring between price action and sentiment, helping identify divergences that may precede reversals.
