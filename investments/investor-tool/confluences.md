# Confluences

Liquidity, positioning, and macro context sharpen the signals you get from trend, dispersion, and anchors.

* **Trend/Momentum:** Pair with RSI/MACD only as confirmationâ€”MA slope is your primary regime filter.
* **Breadth/Rotation:** A/D lines, sector rotation; trims near Upper Band hit different when breadth is narrowing.
* **Volatility:** VIX/term structure; upper-band stretches with rising vol often fade faster.
* **Macro frame:** Policy rates, yield curve, and credit spreads help judge if band stretches are mean-reverting or regime-changing.
* **Timeframe stack:** Weekly MA slope + Quarterly/Monthly WVAP reactions on the Daily chart create a sturdy multi-TF plan.
