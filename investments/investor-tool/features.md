# Features

Everything is tuned to be durable, readable, and adaptable to your investing horizon.

* **Horizon-scaled MA:** Same “years” setting yields a consistent effective length across timeframes.
* **Dispersion bands:** Detect overextension/discount relative to long-run behavior.
* **Anchored WVAP suite:** Use O/H/L/C-based WVAPs as fair-value gravity lines within each chosen period.
* **Multi-period anchors:** Flip anchors (e.g., Year ↔ Quarter ↔ Month) to study nested structure.
* **Minimal clutter:** Lower band computed but hidden by default; enable if your process uses downside bands.
