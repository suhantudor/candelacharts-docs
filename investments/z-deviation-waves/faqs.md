# FAQs

<details>

<summary>“Z-score (σ)” vs “Price @ σ” vs “Price @ Z”—which should I use?</summary>

Start with **Z-score (σ)** to build intuition. Use **Price @ σ** when you want **tradable levels** and alert prices. Use **Price @ Z** when you need **consistent-looking charts** across different tickers for presentations.

<summary>How do I pick the right Period?</summary>

Match it to your timeframe and the asset’s personality. Daily swing traders often like **50**. Go **20–30** for tactical/intraday, **80–100** for calmer HTF context.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does it repaint?</summary>

No. The calculations update intrabar like any rolling indicator and **lock on bar close**.

<details>

<summary>Can I use this intraday?</summary>

Yes. Expect **more frequent ±2σ tags** on lower timeframes—consider a **longer Period** or a touch of **Smoothing** to cut noise.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are ±2σ/±3σ guaranteed reversal zones?</summary>

No. Markets aren’t perfectly normal. Treat σ as **stretch context**, not a promise. Wait for structure/momentum confirmation and always manage risk.
