# Z-Deviation Waves

Price feels noisy until you can name _how far_ it’s drifting from “normal.”&#x20;

**Z-Deviation Waves** does exactly that. It turns your price series into a standardized gauge of stretch—how many standard deviations (σ) away from its recent average the market sits—so you can spot when moves are routine, meaningful, or extreme.&#x20;

Instead of guessing whether something is “overextended,” you’ll see it in plain numbers and clear colors. Use it to prepare for snap-backs, to time pullbacks within trends, or simply to understand when the tape is running hot or cold.
