# Confluences

A σ extreme is a **hint**; conviction comes from agreement elsewhere.

* **Structure first:** σ levels overlapping weekly support/resistance or trendlines carry more weight.
* **Momentum tells:** RSI/MACD/OBV divergence near **±2σ** strengthens mean-reversion.
* **Volatility lens:** ATR expansion at **+2σ** warns of blow-off risk—tighten trails or reduce size.
* **Trend backdrop:** 50/200-MA slope—continuation trades work better with the HTF wind at your back.
* **Breadth/RS:** favor σ setups that align with sector strength or relative-strength leaders.
