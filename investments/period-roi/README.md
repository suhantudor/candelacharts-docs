# Period ROI

Performance over a fixed window answers a simple question: “How much are we up or down since X?”&#x20;

**CandelaCharts – Period ROI** makes that answer immediate by plotting the percent change between today’s daily close and the daily close from a chosen period (1M/3M/6M/1Y or custom days).&#x20;

It keeps the reference on a daily series so your read is consistent across chart timeframes, colors positive vs. negative regimes, and can label the latest value for quick comparisons.
