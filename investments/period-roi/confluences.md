# Confluences

Pair ROI with structure and breadth to build conviction.

* **Trend:** 50/200-day slope to align direction.
* **Breadth/RS:** Sector breadth or relative strength to confirm rotation signals.
* **Volatility:** ATR/VIXâ€”deep negative ROI with rising vol often precedes capitulation bounces.
* **Support/Resistance:** Combine zero-line crosses with base breakouts or retests.
