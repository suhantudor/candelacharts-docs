# Confluences

Use ATH Drawdown to tell you where an asset sits in its cycle, then pair it with complementary tools to decide when and how to act with higher confidence.

CandelaCharts â€” ATH Drawdown works best as the backbone of a **buy-the-dip** framework with a **medium-to-long-term** investment horizon: it tells you _how deep_ in the cycle you are, while complementary tools refine _when_ to step in and how to size risk.
