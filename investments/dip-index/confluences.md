# Confluences

While DIPX provides valuable insight into **market breadth and internal momentum**, it should not be used in isolation.&#x20;

To improve signal accuracy and reduce false triggers, combine DIPX with **macro trend filters, momentum oscillators, volume-based tools, and structural price indicators**.&#x20;

Below are the most effective combinations:

### **1. Macro Trend Filters: M2, VIX, Yield Curves**

Use top-down macro indicators to establish the prevailing market regime — this determines how you interpret DIPX signals.

| Tool                       | Role                          | How to Combine                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **M2 Money Supply (YoY)**  | Measures liquidity conditions | In rising M2 environments (expanding liquidity), bullish DIPX signals carry more weight. Falling M2 favors risk-off interpretation of bearish signals.                |
| **VIX (Volatility Index)** | Gauges fear/greed             | If VIX is above 25, treat bullish DIPX signals as potential bottoms (capitulation). If VIX is below 15, bearish signals may indicate complacency ahead of a pullback. |
| **10Y–2Y Yield Curve**     | Economic health proxy         | Upward-sloping curve supports bullish DIPX signals. Inverted curve increases weight on bearish signals — warns of structural weakness.                                |

**Example**: A bullish triangle appears on SPX DIPX, but the yield curve is deeply inverted and M2 is contracting → treat as a technical bounce, not a structural bottom.

### **2. Momentum Confirmation: RSI, MACD**

These tools confirm whether price momentum aligns with breadth signals.

| ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RSI (14-period)** | Short-term momentum | Use RSI to confirm overbought/oversold conditions. A bullish DIPX signal + RSI < 30 = stronger buy case. A bearish DIPX signal + RSI > 70 = higher conviction. |
| **MACD (12,26,9)**  | Trend momentum      | Look for bullish MACD crossovers to confirm bullish DIPX exits. Bearish divergences on MACD + overbought DIPX = strong warning sign.                           |

**Pro Tip:** Enable **RSI filtering** in your strategy — only act on DIPX signals when RSI is also exiting extreme zones in the same direction.

### **3. Volume & Value-Based Tools: VWAP**

These reflect participation quality and institutional flow.

| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VWAP** | Institutional reference point | <p>In investment analysis:</p><ul><li>Bullish DIPX signal + price > VWAP (1Year or 1Decade) = stronger confirmation</li><li>Bearish DIPX signal + price &#x3C; VWAP = increased downside risk</li></ul> |

### **4. Alternative Macro Indicators (Advanced)**

For global or multi-asset traders, integrate broader macro tools:

| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **World Equity Index (e.g., ACWI)**       | Global risk appetite | If ACWI DIPX is rising, local bullish signals are more reliable. If falling, treat local strength as isolated.              |
| **DXI (Dollar Index)**                    | FX-driven pressure   | Strong dollar often pressures commodities and EM assets. A bearish DIPX signal in gold or crypto + rising DXY = confluence. |
| **Credit Spreads (e.g., HYG–TLT spread)** | Risk sentiment       | Widening spreads (rising risk) reduce reliability of bullish DIPX signals outside defensive sectors.                        |

### Practical Framework: Combining DIPX with Other Tools

<table><thead><tr><th width="82.65234375">Step</th><th>Tool</th><th>Decision Rule</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Macro Regime (M2, VIX, Yield Curve)</strong></td><td>Is the environment bullish, neutral, or risk-off?</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><strong>Price Trend (200 MA, Donchian)</strong></td><td>Is the asset in a bull or bear trend?</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><strong>Momentum (RSI, MACD)</strong></td><td>Is momentum confirming the DIPX signal?</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><strong>Volume/Flow (OBV, VWAP)</strong></td><td>Is participation supporting the move?</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><strong>Signal Execution</strong></td><td>Only act if ≥3 out of 4 conditions align with DIPX</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### **Example Setup (Bullish)**:

* M2 growing YoY → liquidity supportive
* SPX above 200-day MA → uptrend intact
* RSI exits 30 level → momentum turning
* DIPX crosses above 20% → breadth improving\
  → **High-probability dip-buying opportunity**

#### **Example Rejection (Bear Trap)**:

* DIPX shows bullish signal (↑ from 18%)
* But: M2 falling, VIX rising, SPX below 200 MA, RSI flat\
  → **Ignore signal — macro conditions too weak**

By combining DIPX with **macro, momentum, volume, and structural tools**, you transform it from a standalone oscillator into a **core component of a robust decision-making framework** — one that works across equities, commodities, forex, and digital assets.
