# Dip Index ðŸ”œ

The **Dip Index (DIPX)** is a market breadth oscillator that measures the percentage of assets within a selected index or asset class trading above a specified moving averageâ€”such as the 50, 100, 150, or 200-period moving average.&#x20;

While commonly applied to equities, the indicator is adaptable to various financial instruments, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), commodities, cryptocurrencies, and even fixed-income securities.

* Assess the overall health of a market by measuring internal participation in price moves.
* Detect overbought or oversold conditions when momentum becomes concentrated or overly extended.
* Identify divergences between price trends and underlying breadth, which may precede reversals.
* Generate actionable signals when the index exits extreme levels, suggesting renewed momentum or potential exhaustion.
