# Mean Reversion Oscillator ðŸ”œ

The CandelaCharts â€“ Mean Reversion Oscillator (MRO) is a 0â€“100 bounded indicator that measures how far price deviates from its moving average, helping traders spot overbought, oversold, and mean reversion conditions.&#x20;

It can also highlight **divergences** (when price makes a new high/low but the oscillator fails to confirm), which often signals weakening momentum and potential reversals.
