# Confluences

The **Mean Reversion Oscillator (MRO)** works best when used alongside other tools and market context. On its own, it shows when price is stretched away from its mean, but when combined with other signals, it becomes a powerful confirmation tool. Below are the **five strongest confluences** to increase reliability and reduce false signals.

* **Support & Resistance Levels**
  * When MRO signals **Overbought** at a resistance zone → stronger short bias.
  * When MRO signals **Oversold** at a support zone → stronger long bias.
* **Trend Filters (e.g., 200 EMA/SMA)**
  * Fade signals only in the direction of the higher-timeframe trend.
  * Example: Take oversold longs only when price is above the 200 EMA.
* **Volume & Liquidity Tools (VWAP / Volume Profile)**
  * If MRO is OB/OS while price is rejecting VWAP or a high-volume node, the confluence is very strong.
* **Volatility Bands (Bollinger / Keltner)**
  * MRO Overbought + price outside the upper band → potential reversal.
  * MRO Oversold + price outside the lower band → bounce setup.
* **Divergences with Price**
  * **Bullish divergence:** Price makes a lower low, but MRO prints a higher low → momentum loss in sellers.
  * **Bearish divergence:** Price makes a higher high, but MRO prints a lower high → momentum loss in buyers.

⚡ **Pro tip:** The highest probability trades occur when **3 or more confluences** align (e.g., MRO Oversold + Support + Bullish Divergence).
