# Features

The **Mean Reversion Oscillator (MRO)** is designed to be simple yet powerful, giving traders a clear view of how far price has stretched away from its mean. Its features focus on clarity, adaptability, and integration with other trading tools.

* 📊 **Bounded Scale (0–100):** Normalizes price deviations into an easy-to-read range.
* ⚖️ **Configurable Inputs:** Flexible control over MA Length and StdDev Length to match different trading styles (scalping, swing, long-term).
* 🎨 **Dynamic Visuals:** Color-coded signals (red, green, blue) and background shading for instant recognition of extremes.
* ➖ **Reference Levels:** Built-in Overbought, Oversold, and Midline markers to guide interpretation.
* 🔎 **Divergence Detection (manual):** When price forms new highs/lows but MRO doesn’t, it can reveal hidden momentum shifts.
* 🪶 **Lightweight Implementation:** Optimized script runs smoothly, even with multiple indicators on chart.
