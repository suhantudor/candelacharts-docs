# Confluences

Stronger conviction comes from multiple lenses pointing the same way.

* **Trend & momentum:** 50/200-day slope, RSI/MACD to confirm or fade extremes.
* **Liquidity context:** Stablecoin growth, M2, or broad risk appetite indicators.
* **Derivatives & flow:** Funding, OI spikes, basis; extreme MVRV + frothy funding is a caution combo.
* **On-chain breadth:** Active addresses/fees as supporting evidence.
