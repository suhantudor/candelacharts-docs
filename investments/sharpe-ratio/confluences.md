# Confluences

Sharpe gets stronger when aligned with other lenses.

* **Trend context:** 50/200-day slope—elevated Sharpe in uptrends is more durable.
* **Volatility regime:** ATR/VIX—falling vol + positive Sharpe supports compounding.
* **Drawdown rules:** Tighten risk when Sharpe decays toward 0 even if price trends up.
* **Relative strength:** Pair with 3–6M ROI to confirm leadership.
