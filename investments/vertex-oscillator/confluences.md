# Confluences

The Vertex Oscillator is most powerful when used in combination with other tools. Confluences help confirm signals and reduce false positives.

* **Trend Filters** → Align oscillator signals with higher timeframe trends (e.g., moving averages, Ichimoku, or market structure).
* **Support & Resistance** → Zone signals near strong S/R levels strengthen the case for reversals.
* **Volume Analysis** → Rising volume during undervaluation or euphoria zones increases reliability.
* **Candlestick Patterns** → Reversal patterns (e.g., pin bars, engulfing) appearing in extreme oscillator zones often confirm turning points.
* **Market Context** → Combine with fundamentals or macro events to avoid misinterpreting oscillator extremes during news-driven moves.
