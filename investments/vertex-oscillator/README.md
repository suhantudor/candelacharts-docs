# Vertex Oscillator

The **Vertex Oscillator** by CandelaCharts is a momentum indicator that combines price deviation, relative volume, and adaptive volatility scaling.&#x20;

It highlights:

* **Undervaluation (≤ -2)** → Accumulation / potential rebound zones
* **Euphoria (≥ +2)** → Overheated conditions / profit-taking zones
* **Neutral (\~0)** → Balanced market state with no strong bias

The oscillator also helps traders spot **bullish and bearish divergences**, often signaling potential reversals.&#x20;

With customizable styling, real-time alerts, and compatibility across all markets and timeframes, it serves as both a **confirmation tool** and a **standalone gauge of market extremes**.
