# Confluences

This section suggests light add-ons that boost conviction without clutter.

* **Higher-timeframe bias:** align trade TF with 4H/D trend.
* **Structure:** S/R, supply–demand, or anchored levels for entries/exits.
* **VWAP/EMAs:** acceptance beyond **±1** near AVWAP or 50/200 EMA supports continuation.
* **Volatility framing:** ATR/Bollinger to judge whether a stretch should run or snap back.
