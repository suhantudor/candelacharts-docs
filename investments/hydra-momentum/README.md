# Hydra Momentum

**Hydra Momentum** is a two-engine momentum framework packed into one indicator:

* **Directional engine**: a composite oscillator that blends well-known tools (RSI, MFI, MACD, CCI, TSI, RVI, Stoch %K, Williams %R, ROC, Momentum, CMO). They’re normalized and averaged into one line—the **Directional Jumper**—so you can read bullish/bearish pressure at a glance.
* **Nondirectional engine**: a separate “market quality” gauge built from ATR, ADX, Linear Regression strength, and absolute correlation. It doesn’t tell you _direction_—it tells you whether conditions are strong/clean enough to matter.

The main line sits around **−1…+1**. The band is shaded for context, and the line uses a gradient (orange → purple → blue) to hint at acceleration. Moves **beyond ±1** mark potential extremes; background and gradient fills emphasize those zones. You can optionally plot a **moving average of the oscillator** for crossover logic. Regular **bullish/bearish divergences** are auto-labeled, with an optional filter to only show higher-probability cases (when the oscillator’s pivot was outside ±1).

> **Bottom line:** Hydra helps answer two questions—_“Which way?”_ (Directional) and _“Is this worth trading?”_ (Nondirectional).
