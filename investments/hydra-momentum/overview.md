This section orients you to what Hydra is and when it helps.

* **What it is:** a two-engine oscillator—Directional momentum plus a Quality filter—normalized around 0 with stretch context at ±1.
* **What it solves:** avoids taking signals in sloppy, low-quality tape; favors moves with confirmation and follow-through.
* **When to use:** trend-following, pullback entries, momentum ignition, and divergence fades—across intraday to swing timeframes.
* **How it adapts:** selectable components, optional smoothing/MA, and adjustable thresholds to match asset volatility.
