# Features

The design favors legibility, adaptability, and minimal assumptions.

* **Log-momentum core:** Scale-free measure of thrust over `Length`.
* **Adaptive gradient:** ±(k × stdev) color span for consistent heat.
* **Level structure:** Toggle ±L1/±L2 and shaded zones to frame impulses.
* **Zero baseline:** Clear positive/negative regime separator.
* **Context MAs:** Price vs. smoothed-source SMAs in the same pane.
