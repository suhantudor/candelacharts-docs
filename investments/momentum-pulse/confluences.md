# Confluences

Momentum reads get stronger when paired with other structure.

* **Trend:** Higher-timeframe MA slope to filter counter-trend signals.
* **Volatility:** ATR/VIXâ€”impulses under rising vol often overshoot and snap back.
* **Market structure:** Breakout/breakdown levels or liquidity pools for context.
* **Breadth/Relative strength:** Confirm impulses with broader participation or RS.
