# Momentum Pulse

Momentum is context—without it, price action is just noise; with it, trends and squeezes stand out and decision-making gets faster.&#x20;

**CandelaCharts – Momentum Pulse** standardizes momentum with log math, adaptive coloring, and simple thresholds so you can read regimes and impulses at a glance.
