# Confluences

Context turns good signals into great ones—pair Z-Score with:

* **Trend filters:** 50/200 MA slope or higher-timeframe structure.
* **Volatility:** VIX/ATR; extremes under rising vol unwind faster.
* **Momentum/RSI:** Use to confirm or fade late-stage pushes near +2..+3σ.
* **Liquidity/Macro (for crypto/equities):** Stablecoin growth, M2, funding/term structure.
