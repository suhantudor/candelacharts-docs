# Features

Designed for clarity, comparability, and minimal assumptions.

* **Standardized stretch:** Mayer Multiple remapped to a consistent −3..+3 Z-Score.
* **Cumulative→rolling SMA:** Honest early behavior, classic thereafter; no repaint.
* **Smoothing:** Z-Score EMA for regime clarity without hiding extremes.
* **Extreme highlights:** Optional fills for \[+2..+3] and \[−3..−2].
* **Visual heat:** Optional bar coloring by Z-Score.
