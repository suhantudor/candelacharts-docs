# Sortino Ratio

Downside risk is what sinks portfoliosâ€”**Sortino** focuses exactly there by measuring how efficiently returns beat a target while **only** penalizing the harmful volatility.&#x20;

Set your target (risk-free or custom), choose simple or log returns, and decide whether to view context via rolling percentiles or classic fixed levels.&#x20;

The result is a drawdown-aware quality gauge you can compare across assets and regimes.
