# Confluences

Sortino shines when the rest of the tape agrees.

* **Trend context:** 50/200-day slope; high Sortino in uptrends is more durable.
* **Volatility regime:** ATR/VIX; falling vol with high Sortino supports compounding.
* **Risk controls:** Use dips below 1 as a throttle—tighten size/new risk.
* **Relative strength / ROI:** Pair with 3–6M ROI to confirm leadership.
