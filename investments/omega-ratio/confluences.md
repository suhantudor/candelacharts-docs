# Confluences

Omega gets sharper when the tape, flow, and risk all agree.

* **Trend filters:** 50/200-MA slope to align with the dominant direction.
* **Volatility regime:** ATR/VIXâ€”surging vol can compress Omega despite trend; adjust targets/windows accordingly.
* **Drawdown control:** Use **Omega < 1** as a risk-off switch (skip new entries, reduce leverage).
* **Breadth & RS:** Favor setups when Omega > 1 aligns with strong market breadth/relative strength.
