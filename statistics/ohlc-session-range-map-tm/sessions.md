# Sessions

**The OHLC Session** **Range Map performs calculations that are specifically tailored to distinct trading sessions—commonly referred to as "killzones"—to deliver more focused and context-aware market analysis.**

By aligning with the natural rhythm of institutional activity across global financial centers, the script offers enhanced insight into price behavior during each key period:

* **Asia Session:** 20:00 – 00:00 (UTC)
* **London Session:** 02:00 – 05:00 (UTC)
* **New York AM Session:** 09:30 – 11:00 (UTC)
* **New York Lunch Session:** 12:00 – 13:00 (UTC)
* **New York PM Session:** 13:30 – 16:00 (UTC)
* **Custom**

Each session is treated as a distinct phase, allowing traders to observe how price interacts with liquidity and manipulation levels during specific windows of high institutional activity.&#x20;

This session-based approach helps users identify patterns, anticipate market behavior, and refine entry or exit strategies with greater precision.
