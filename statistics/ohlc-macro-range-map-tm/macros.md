# Macros

**The OHLC Macro Range Map is engineered to deliver precise and targeted market analysis by focusing on key institutional timing windows—known as trading macros.**

These macros represent strategically defined micro-periods within major trading sessions where significant liquidity shifts, volatility spikes, and institutional order flow are most likely to occur.&#x20;

By aligning its calculations with these high-impact windows, the OHLC Macro Range Map allows traders to isolate moments of potential smart money activity with exceptional clarity.

The tool analyzes the following key macro timeframes:

* **London Session:**\
  • 02:33 – 03:00 (UTC)\
  • 04:03 – 04:30 (UTC)
* **New York AM Session:**\
  • 08:50 – 09:10 (UTC)\
  • 09:50 – 10:10 (UTC)\
  • 10:50 – 11:10 (UTC)
* **New York Lunch Session:**\
  • 11:50 – 12:10 (UTC)
* **New York PM Session:**\
  • 13:10 – 13:40 (UTC)\
  • 15:15 – 15:45 (UTC)
* **Custom**

These time intervals are not arbitrary—they are derived from historical patterns of institutional engagement, where price manipulation, liquidity grabs, and major directional moves often originate.&#x20;

By tailoring its calculations to these specific moments, the OHLC Macro Range Map helps traders identify **high-probability setups**, **anticipate market reversals**, and **better align with the underlying narrative of smart money behavior**.

Whether you're scalping intraday or looking to refine your entry timing, this macro-focused approach offers a valuable edge by revealing where and when the most meaningful price action is likely to unfold.
