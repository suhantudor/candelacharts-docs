ICT traders identify manipulation through wicks extending in the opposite direction of the candle's close—movements often designed to mislead participants into taking positions against the prevailing trend. These manipulative moves signal potential manipulation legs and provide critical insights.

By analyzing these patterns, traders can anticipate the candle's distribution phase, where price extends to higher or lower levels. This phase reveals valuable clues for spotting liquidity draws, potential retracements, and key reversal points.
