# FAQs

<details>

<summary>How does it work?</summary>

After signing up for a plan, you'll be directed to a page where you can access your tools immediately. We'll also send you a link via email in case you need it later.

You'll be asked to connect your TradingView and Discord accounts, both of which are free platforms that our tools operate on.

We do not store your payment details; they are encrypted and securely processed through _Stripe_ on Whop for safe transactions on our site.

<summary>Which markets are supported?</summary>

Our indicators are compatible with all markets available on TradingView, including stocks, crypto, forex, and commodities, across all timeframes such as 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d, and more.

The toolkits offered in each plan are designed to support various trading styles, whether you’re into scalping, swing trading, or long-term investing, providing valuable technical insights for your strategy.

<details>

<summary>How to setup?</summary>

After signing up on our website and purchase a subscription in maximum `12h` the tool will be assigned to your provided Tradingview username.

To start using them, simply open a chart on TradingView.

Once your chart is open, click on "Indicators" (or type `/`) to access the indicator menu, then select "Invite-only Scripts." You’ll see the toolkit names listed there; click on any of them to add to your chart.

You don’t need to use all the toolkits at once. We recommend exploring our toolkits to find the features that best complement your trading style.

<summary>Can I achieve a winning outcome on every trade with this?</summary>

Absolutely not. No indicator, algorithm, system, or strategy can guarantee a 100% accurate prediction of market movements.

While we offer a comprehensive range of indicators, both free and paid, our tools do not ensure profits if used without careful consideration.

We strongly advise against relying on any tool blindly. Trading is inherently risky, and past performance does not guarantee future outcomes.

<details>

<summary>Why do the indicators occasionally result in a timeout?</summary>

You may experience timeouts with our indicators for a few reasons:

* **Too many indicators on your chart**: TradingView loads indicators sequentially from top to bottom. If you have more than 10 indicators, it can significantly slow down the loading process, causing delays or timeouts for others.
* **Excessive chart tabs open**: If you leave multiple charts open in your browser, especially on a laptop, this can cause performance issues. In such cases, refreshing the page is often necessary to resolve loading problems.
