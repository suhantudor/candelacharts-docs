# Alerts

Alerts are clear, timely, and not spammy. Each one says what happened in simple language and includes the symbol and timeframe. They trigger once per bar close to avoid noise.

### **What you can enable**

* **Stretch entered:** Heads‑up that we’re in a hot zone.
* **Stretch resolved:** Returned toward the band—potential fade timing.
* **Divergence spotted:** Non‑confirmation appeared—prepare.
* **Divergence confirmed:** Higher‑quality pattern—often actionable.

### **Healthy setup**

Start with the last two categories (resolution + confirmed). Add “spotted” only if you like to prepare early. Use “entered” when you’re specifically hunting trend days.

### **Keep it clean**

Turn on only the families you actually use. If you start ignoring a category, switch it off. Your attention is precious.
