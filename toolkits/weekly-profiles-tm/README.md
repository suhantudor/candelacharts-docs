# Weekly Profilesâ„¢

ICT weekly profiles are structured conceptual frameworks designed to outline typical patterns of price behavior over the course of a trading week.&#x20;

These profiles serve as analytical tools, offering traders insights into recurring market tendencies and helping them identify potential opportunities and risks.&#x20;

Each ICT weekly profile has distinctive characteristics that provide valuable clues for anticipating potential market movements, such as directional biases, consolidation phases, or volatility spikes.

It is crucial to emphasize, however, that these profiles are not fixed or guaranteed predictions. Instead, they act as flexible guides for understanding broader market tendencies.&#x20;

Traders should apply these frameworks in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools, as well as sound risk management strategies, to make informed decisions in dynamic market conditions.
