# Metrics

Metrics are displayed next to a block, positioned near the most recent historical price bar. These metrics reflect the accumulated volume within the interval used to create the block.

The volume information helps assess the significance of each block, with larger volumes indicating a more substantial block.

Additionally, the percentage shown indicates the proportion of the order block's volume relative to the total accumulated volume of all Volumetric Blocks on the chart.

This percentage provides a quick way to identify which Volumetric Blocks are more noteworthy and potentially more influential in the market.
