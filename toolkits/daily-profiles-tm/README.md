# Daily Profiles™

The ICT Daily Profiles by CandelaCharts rooted on the ICT teachings represent a pattern-based approach to trading that focuses on identifying and analyzing the key highs and lows of various intraday trading sessions.&#x20;

These profiles provide a structured framework to understand how price action evolves across distinct periods, such as the 00:00–06:00 (Session I - Tokyo), 06:01–12:00 (Session II - London), 12:01–18:00 (Session III - NY), and 18:01–23:59 (Session IV - Syndey) sessions.&#x20;

The day is divided into four main sessions to accurately identify potential highs and lows, ensuring precise probability detection.

By pinpointing the critical turning points in these sessions, traders gain insights into potential areas of liquidity, support, and resistance.
