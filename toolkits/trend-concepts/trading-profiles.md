# Trading Profiles

**Trading Profiles** are pre-configured settings that automatically optimize all component parameters based on your trading style. Instead of manually adjusting each component's settings, you can select a profile that matches your approach, and the indicator will automatically configure Flux Trend length, Surge Waves length, and Velocity Bands deviation period.

### Scalping

**Settings:** Flux Trend: 30, Surge Waves: 30, Velocity Bands: 300

Designed for fast, responsive trading on lower timeframes. The Scalping profile uses shorter periods to catch quick price movements and provide faster signals. Ideal for 1m, 5m, and 15m charts where speed is essential.

### Intraday

**Settings:** Flux Trend: 50, Surge Waves: 50, Velocity Bands: 500

The default balanced profile for day trading. Provides a good balance between responsiveness and stability. Works well on 15m, 30m, 1h, and 4h timeframes for intraday trading strategies.

### Swing

**Settings:** Flux Trend: 80, Surge Waves: 70, Velocity Bands: 800

Optimized for swing trading with slower, more stable parameters. Reduces noise and false signals while maintaining trend-following capabilities. Best suited for 4h, daily, and weekly charts for multi-day positions.

### Investment

**Settings:** Flux Trend: 100, Surge Waves: 100, Velocity Bands: 1200

Long-term focus with the slowest, most stable settings. Designed for position trading and investment strategies. Ideal for daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes where you want to filter out short-term noise and focus on major trends.

### Custom

When Custom is selected, the indicator uses the manual input values you set for each component:

* **Flux Trend Length** (default: 60)
* **Surge Waves Length** (default: 50)
* **Velocity Bands Deviation Length** (default: 500)

Use Custom mode when you need specific parameter values that don't match any preset profile, or when you want to fine-tune the indicator for a particular instrument or market condition.

### Choosing the Right Profile

* **Match your timeframe**: Higher timeframes generally work better with Swing or Investment profiles, while lower timeframes benefit from Scalping or Intraday profiles.
* **Match your trading style**: If you prefer quick entries and exits, use Scalping or Intraday. If you prefer holding positions longer, use Swing or Investment.
* **Experiment**: You can use a higher timeframe profile on a lower timeframe chart for more stable signals, or vice versa for more responsive signals.
