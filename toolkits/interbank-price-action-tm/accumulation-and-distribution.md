# Accumulation & Distribution

### Wyckoff-Style Zones <a href="#user-content--wyckoff-style-zones" id="user-content--wyckoff-style-zones"></a>

Markets move in cycles of Accumulation (buying) and Distribution (selling). This tool helps you identify these consolidation phases before the markup or markdown begins.

#### How It Works <a href="#user-content-how-it-works" id="user-content-how-it-works"></a>

We scan for specific price patterns that match the schematic of Accumulation or Distribution.

* **Accumulation Zone**: Price makes a series of moves that trap sellers and build long positions. Expect a breakout to the upside.
* **Distribution Zone**: Price makes a series of moves that trap buyers and offload positions. Expect a breakdown to the downside.

### Settings <a href="#user-content-settings" id="user-content-settings"></a>

#### Logic <a href="#user-content-logic" id="user-content-logic"></a>

* **Slow Mode**: Looks for a complex, 6-point verification structure. This is more reliable but occurs less frequently.
* **Fast Mode**: Looks for a quicker, 4-point structure. Good for lower timeframes.

#### Visuals <a href="#user-content-visuals" id="user-content-visuals"></a>

* **Projected Box**: Draws a box around the zone to highlight the consolidation area.
* **Polyline**: traces the price path within the zone to show the structure.
