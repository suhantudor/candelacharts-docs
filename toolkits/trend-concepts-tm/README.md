# Trend Concepts 🔜

**Trend Concepts** is a comprehensive trend analysis toolkit for TradingView that combines four powerful, independent components to identify market direction, trend strength, and trading opportunities across all timeframes.

#### Four Core Components

### **Bias Magnet**&#x20;

An adaptive baseline that tracks trend direction using half-trend style logic. It calculates trend strength (0-100) from slope and momentum, displays dynamic line transparency based on intensity, and provides flip signals when trends change. Includes polarity bars that show MFI-based momentum direction with intensity-based transparency.

### **Flux Trend**

ATR-based trend bands that flip between bullish and bearish regimes. Creates gradient-filled zones between main and secondary bands, marks trend flips with visual symbols and connecting lines, and detects exit signals when price leaves the zone after touching it. Ideal for identifying trend reversals and continuation setups.

### **Surge Waves**

A two-pole filter that smooths price action and detects sustained momentum runs. Tracks consecutive rising or falling bars, marks sustained runs (5+ bars) with shapes, and provides confirmation signals when runs begin. The filled tube envelope provides visual context for momentum direction and strength.

### **Velocity Bands**

Dynamic deviation-based bands that adapt to market conditions. Uses outlier-filtered standard deviation to create +1/+2 and -1/-2 bands around a weighted moving average. Detects re-entry signals when price returns from extreme zones and rejection signals when price enters bands but fails to hold. Enhanced gradient fills highlight when price is outside bands.
