# Trend Concepts™ 🔜

**Trend Concepts** is a comprehensive trend analysis toolkit for TradingView that combines four powerful, independent components to identify market direction, trend strength, and trading opportunities across all timeframes.

**Bias Magnet** identifies trend direction via an adaptive baseline with strength visualization and momentum polarity bars; **Flux Trend** detects reversals and continuations using ATR-based bands with gradient zones; **Surge Waves** tracks momentum through a two-pole filter that highlights sustained runs; and **Velocity Bands** identifies extreme conditions and mean reversion opportunities using dynamic deviation-based bands with re-entry and rejection signals.
