# Key Levels

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis <a href="#user-content--multi-timeframe-analysis" id="user-content--multi-timeframe-analysis"></a>

Professional traders always chart from the "Top Down." They know where the Weekly High or Monthly Open is, even when they are scalping the 1-minute chart.

This module brings those critical levels onto your current timeframe, so you never lose sight of the big picture.

### The Levels <a href="#user-content--the-levels" id="user-content--the-levels"></a>

We automatically plot the **Open**, **High**, **Low**, and **Close** of the previous period for the timeframes you select.

* **PDH / PDL**: Previous Daily High / Low.
* **PWH / PWL**: Previous Weekly High / Low.
* **PMH / PML**: Previous Monthly High / Low.
* **DO / WO / MO**: Daily / Weekly / Monthly Open.

#### Why It Matters <a href="#user-content-why-it-matters" id="user-content-why-it-matters"></a>

* **Liquidity**: The previous day's High and Low are classic liquidity targets. Price often sweeps them before reversing.
* **Bias**: If price is above the Weekly Open, the weekly bias is Bullish. If below, it's Bearish.

### Configuration <a href="#user-content-configuration" id="user-content-configuration"></a>

#### 1. Timeframe Selection <a href="#user-content-1-timeframe-selection" id="user-content-1-timeframe-selection"></a>

Enable only what you need to avoid "Spaghetti Charts":

* **Daily**: Essential for Day Trading.
* **Weekly**: Essential for Swing Trading.
* **Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly**: For macro analysis and long-term investing.

#### 2. Line Styles <a href="#user-content-2-line-styles" id="user-content-2-line-styles"></a>

* **Pivot Lines (High/Low)**: Usually plotted solid or distinct to mark them as barriers.
* **Open Line**: Useful to see "Green Day" vs "Red Day" status.
* **Mid Line**: The 50% level of the previous candle. Often acts as a subtle support/resistance.

#### 3. Smart Labels <a href="#user-content-3-smart-labels" id="user-content-3-smart-labels"></a>

* Labels are placed on the right side of the chart to avoid obscuring price action.
* Example: `PWH (1.23450)` = Previous Weekly High at price 1.23450.
