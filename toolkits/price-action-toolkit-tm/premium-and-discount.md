# Premium & Discount

### Dealing Range Analysis <a href="#user-content--dealing-range-analysis" id="user-content--dealing-range-analysis"></a>

To consistently make profitable trades, you need to buy low (cheap) and sell high (expensive). In institutional trading, this concept is formalized as **Premium** and **Discount** zones within a **Dealing Range**.

This tool acts as your automated "valuation" scanner, ensuring you never buy at the top or sell at the bottom.

### The Zones <a href="#user-content--the-zones" id="user-content--the-zones"></a>

The indicator identifies the current **Trading Range** defined by the most recent major Swing High and Swing Low.

* **Premium Zone (Top 50%)**: 🔴
  * _Status_: Expensive.
  * _Action_: Prioritize **Short** setups. Institutions are looking to offload positions here.
* **Discount Zone (Bottom 50%)**: 🟢
  * _Status_: Cheap.
  * _Action_: Prioritize **Long** setups. Institutions are looking to accumulate positions here.
* **Equilibrium (50% Level)**:
  * _Status_: Fair Value.
  * _Action_: Price often consolidates around this level before choosing a direction.

#### Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) <a href="#user-content--optimal-trade-entry-ote" id="user-content--optimal-trade-entry-ote"></a>

Within the Premium or Discount zones, we highlight a specific "sweet spot" (typically the 70-79% retracement). This is high-probability reversal area where risk-to-reward is maximized.

### Structure Labels <a href="#user-content-structure-labels" id="user-content-structure-labels"></a>

We also annotate the boundaries of the range to give you context on the trend:

* **Strong High**: A high that broke structure (made a new low). It is expected to hold as resistance. _Stop Loss placement: Safe._
* **Weak High**: A high that failed to break structure. It is likely to be targeted as liquidity. _Take Profit target: Ideal._
* **Strong Low**: A low that broke structure (made a new high). It is expected to hold as support.
* **Weak Low**: A low that failed to break structure. Likely to be swept.

### Visual Customization <a href="#user-content-visual-customization" id="user-content-visual-customization"></a>

Choose the aesthetic that fits your charting style:

* **Classic**: Distinctly colored zones (Red for Premium, Green for Discount). Best for beginners.
* **Modern**: Sleek, minimalist shading that blends into the background.
* **Minimalist**: Only draws the critical levels (0, 0.5, 1) without background fills.
* **Simple**: Just the range boundaries.
