# Blocks

### Footprints of Smart Money <a href="#user-content--footprints-of-smart-money" id="user-content--footprints-of-smart-money"></a>

**Blocks** represent the specific candles where institutions initiated large orders. Unlike standard Support & Resistance lines, Blocks are dynamic zones that tell you _where_ the big money entered the market.

When price returns to these zones, institutions often defend their positions, leading to predictable reactions.

### Block Types <a href="#user-content-block-types" id="user-content-block-types"></a>

#### 1. Order Block (OB) <a href="#user-content-1-order-block-ob" id="user-content-1-order-block-ob"></a>

The classic reversal zone.

* **Bullish OB**: The last _down-close_ candle before a massive move up that broke structure.
  * _Psychology_: Institutions sold to engineer liquidity before buying heavily. When price returns, they mitigate their drawdown, causing a bounce.
* **Bearish OB**: The last _up-close_ candle before a massive move down that broke structure.

#### 2. Breaker Block (BB) <a href="#user-content-2-breaker-block-bb" id="user-content-2-breaker-block-bb"></a>

A failed Order Block that creates a reversal opportunity.

* **Logic**: Imagine a Bullish OB that _fails_ to hold price. Price smashes right through it.
* **The Flip**: That failed buy zone now becomes a sell zone (Resistance). This is excellent for trading reversals or stop hunts.

#### 3. Swing Order Block (SOB) <a href="#user-content-3-swing-order-block-sob" id="user-content-3-swing-order-block-sob"></a>

* **Logic**: Unlike standard OBs which can form anywhere, SOBs are strictly derived from major **Swing Points**.
* **Usage**: These carry significantly more weight and are ideal for Higher Timeframe (HTF) analysis.

### Volume & Strength <a href="#user-content--volume--strength" id="user-content--volume--strength"></a>

Not all blocks are powerful. We use volume analysis to grade them for you:

* **💪 Strong**: The block was formed with high relative volume. Probability of holding: **High**.
* **⚖️ Balanced**: The block had average volume. Probability of holding: **Medium**.
* **🥀 Weak**: The block had low volume. Probability of holding: **Low**. Use with caution.
