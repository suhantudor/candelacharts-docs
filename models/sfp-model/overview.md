# Overview

**CandelaCharts – SFP Model** is a sophisticated indicator built to identify and display Swing Failure Patterns (SFPs), commonly referred to as liquidity grabs, fakeouts, or Turtle Soup setups.



Its core objective is to help traders pinpoint high-probability reversal zones formed by liquidity sweeps, while delivering robust contextual insight through higher-timeframe structure, adaptive boundaries, and integrated model performance metrics.
