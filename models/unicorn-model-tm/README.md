# Unicorn Model™

The **Inner Circle Trader (ICT)** methodology, developed by Michael J. Huddleston, centers around the concept of "Smart Money" — the actions of institutional traders who drive the market.&#x20;

Among ICT's vast library of trading concepts, the **Unicorn Model** stands out as a specific intraday or short-term trade setup designed to capture high-probability moves during key times of the trading day.
