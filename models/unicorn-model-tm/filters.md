# Filters

The Unicorn Model allows traders to filter potential trade setups by specific **Killzones**, such as Asia, London, NY AM, NY Launch, and NY PM.&#x20;

These Killzones represent high-activity periods where institutional algorithms are most active, and where liquidity and volatility tend to concentrate—offering a clearer context for high-probability trade setups.

<table><thead><tr><th width="224.4140625"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Asia (20:00 - 00:00)</td><td>Marks the start of the trading day with moderate volatility. Often sets up liquidity levels that later sessions may target.</td></tr><tr><td>London (02:00 - 05:00)</td><td>High-volume session as major European markets open. Often establishes the day’s directional bias with strong institutional activity.</td></tr><tr><td>NY AM (09:30 - 11:00)</td><td>U.S. equity market open. A key window for volatility spikes and liquidity grabs, making it ideal for Turtle Soup reversals.</td></tr><tr><td>NY Launch (12:00 - 13:00)</td><td>Midday session where markets often pause or reverse. Useful for identifying continuation or reversal patterns.</td></tr><tr><td>NY PM (13:30 - 16:00)</td><td>Final hours of the U.S. session. Often sees profit-taking and closing moves, creating opportunities for late-day setups.</td></tr></tbody></table>

The model also supports **custom time range filters**, enabling users to tailor the analysis to their unique trading hours or market conditions. This flexibility enhances the model’s adaptability, ensuring traders stay focused on the sessions that align with their strategy and improve execution precision.
