# PD Arrays

The Turtle Soup Model (TSM) utilizes two distinct sets of PD Arrays: one for Higher Time Frames (HTF) and one for Lower Time Frames (LTF).

These arrays, referred to as:

* **FVG** (Fair Value Gap)
* **IFVG** (Inverse Fair Value Gap)

are crucial components of market analysis and trading strategy.

### HTF PD Arrays

HTF PD Arrays serve as key levels of interest, highlighting significant market zones where sharp price movements (sweeps) are likely to occur.&#x20;

These arrays represent high-probability reversal points when touched by a price sweep. A sweep that reaches an HTF PD Array signals a strong likelihood of price reversal, making these levels vital for identifying major turning points in the market.

Traders can use HTF PD Arrays to monitor for price reactions. Their role in signaling market reversals or retracements makes them essential in determining when a trend may change direction.

### LTF PD Arrays

LTF PD Arrays are instrumental in pinpointing entry points. When a model, such as a Sweep or Market Structure Shift (MSS), forms on the chart, the Turtle Soup Model highlights nearby PD Arrays that align with the newly formed structure.&#x20;

These arrays act as reference levels for entering trades, allowing traders to make informed decisions about positioning.&#x20;

Whether entering in the direction of the trend or anticipating a reversal, these levels offer key insights for optimal entry timing.

The lower timeframe PD Arrays are essential for model formation. In the absence of a LTF PD Array, the model is considered low probability and will not be formed.

### Key Points

* **HTF PD Arrays (FVG/IFVG)**: These arrays function as critical support or resistance levels. When touched by a market sweep, they suggest potential reversals or retracements. They are essential for identifying key price levels where significant market shifts may occur.
* **LTF PD Arrays**: These arrays provide entry points, helping traders identify precise levels to enter the market once a sweep or market structure shift (MSS) occurs. The proximity of these arrays to newly formed market structures enables traders to make timely, informed entry decisions.

By combining HTF PD Arrays for reversal identification and LTF PD Arrays for precise entries, the Turtle Soup Model equips traders with a comprehensive framework for both market analysis and execution.&#x20;

This dual approach ensures that traders can effectively time their entries, whether they are capitalizing on trend continuations or anticipating market reversals.
