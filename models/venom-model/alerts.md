# Alerts

### Available Alerts

Four independent alert conditions are available:

* **SFP Formed (Bullish)** — fires when a new bullish SFP pattern is first detected
* **SFP Formed (Bearish)** — fires when a new bearish SFP pattern is first detected
* **SFP Confirmed (Bullish)** — fires when a bullish SFP receives confirmation close
* **SFP Confirmed (Bearish)** — fires when a bearish SFP receives confirmation close

{% hint style="info" %}
When “High Probability SFPs” is enabled, alerts only trigger for SFPs that pass the channel/trendline interaction filter.
{% endhint %}
