# Dashboard

The optional dashboard shows **only the most recent SFP** and can display any combination of the following fields (all configurable):

* Type (Bullish or Bearish – colored accordingly)
* Current Status (with matching color)
* Volume (formatted with K/M/B suffix)
* Swing Price
* Current opposing channel line value
* Chart timeframe
* Asset ticker
* Market type (from syminfo)
* Pivot length used (only visible in Automatic mode)

The dashboard helps traders quickly assess context without needing to hover over labels or count bars manually.
