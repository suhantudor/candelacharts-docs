# Statuses

The indicator uses six mutually exclusive statuses with the following priority order (highest to lowest):

### **Invalidated**

Orange New opposite-direction SFP formed before confirmation, or setup aged out / price violated range rules.

### **Successful**

Green Price reached the **channel** opposing boundary after confirmation (strongest positive outcome).

### **Partial Success**

Lime Price reached the **trendline** opposing boundary after confirmation, but has not yet reached the channel line.

### **Failed**

Red After confirmation, price violated the swing price level **or** the sweep wick extreme in the wrong direction.

### **Confirmed**

blue Price closed beyond the opposing price in the expected reversal direction — waiting for success or failure.

### **Unconfirmed**

gray Pattern detected but confirmation close has not yet occurred.
