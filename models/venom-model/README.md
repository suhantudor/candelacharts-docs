**CandelaCharts – SFP Model** is an advanced indicator designed to detect and visualize **Swing Failure Patterns (SFP)** — also known as liquidity grabs, fakeouts or Turtle Soup setups.

It combines:

* precise SFP pattern recognition
* higher timeframe (HTF) candle rendering with liquidity sweep visualization
* dynamic trendlines and regression-based channels
* multi-timeframe success/failure tracking
* optional high-probability filtering using channel or trendline interaction
* automatic multi-length pivot scanning mode
* rich status-aware labeling and a configurable information dashboard

The main purpose is to help traders clearly see high-probability reversal zones created by liquidity sweeps, while providing strong contextual information through higher timeframe structure, dynamic boundaries, and model performance feedback.
