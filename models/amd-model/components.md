# Components

The AMD Model projects several visual components onto your chart. Understanding what each line and box represents is key to using the tool effectively.

### 1. The "Ghost" Candles (HTF Candles)

These are the large, semi-transparent candles that appear in the background. They represent the **Higher Timeframe (HTF)** you have selected.

* **Implication:** You can instantly see if the HTF is Bullish (Green) or Bearish (Red) without switching charts.
* **Wicks:** The thin lines extending from the ghost candle show the HTF wicks (high/low range).

### 2. Phase Boxes

The colored boxes highlight the specific **AMD Phase** the market is currently in (or has completed):

* **Blue Box (A):** Accumulation. This marks the initial range or consolidation.
* **Red Box (M):** Manipulation. This highlights the false move or liquidity grab.
* **Green Box (D):** Distribution. This shows the expansion or real move.
* **Labels (A, M, D):** Small letters inside the boxes clearly label each phase.

### 3. Trace Lines

These are subtle lines that "trace" the path of the HTF candle as it develops.

* **Open/Close Line:** A solid line connecting the HTF Open and Current Price.
* **High/Low Line:** Dotted or solid lines tracking the highest and lowest points reached so far.

### 4. CISD Levels

When a **Change in State of Delivery (CISD)** is confirmed:

* **Line:** A distinct horizontal line appears at the breakout level.
* **Role:** This line acts as a "line in the sand." If price stays on the correct side of it, the distribution phase is valid.

### 5. Liquidity Lines

* **Sweeps:** Short lines marking where price briefly poked above/below a key level.
* **EQH/EQL:** Dotted lines connecting equal highs or lows, warning you of potential magnets for price.

### 6. Information Labels

* **Index Label:** Shows which HTF candle you are looking at (e.g., "1H").
* **Time Remaining:** A countdown timer showing how long until the current HTF candle closes.
