# Terminology

Here are some key terms and acronyms you will encounter with the AMD Model:

### **AMD** (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution)

This is the heart of the model. It refers to the **three phases** every significant market move goes through:

1. **Accumulation:** The building of positions, typically in a sideways range.
2. **Manipulation:** The "Judas" move against the intended direction, designed to trap traders and grab liquidity.
3. **Distribution:** The expansion or real move in the intended direction.

### **HTF / LTF**

* **HTF (Higher Timeframe):** The larger timeframe context you want to analyze (e.g., Daily, 4-Hour). The model projects this candle structure onto your chart.
* **LTF (Lower Timeframe):** The timeframe you are currently looking at (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute). This is where you execute your trades.

### **CISD** (Change in State of Delivery)

This is your **confirmation signal**. When price breaks and closes beyond a significant level after a manipulation, it signals a "Change in State of Delivery."

* **Bullish CISD:** Price breaks above the Manipulation High.
* **Bearish CISD:** Price breaks below the Manipulation Low. Seeing a CISD confirms that the manipulation phase is likely over and distribution has begun.

### **Sweep**

A **Sweep** occurs when price briefly trades beyond a previous high or low (taking out liquidity) but then reverses and closes back inside the range. This is a classic sign of a "fake-out" or manipulation.

### **EQH / EQL**

* **EQH (Equal Highs):** Two or more highs at roughly the same level.
* **EQL (Equal Lows):** Two or more lows at roughly the same level. These are often considered "magnets" or targets for price because many stop-loss orders rest above/below them.

### **KOP** (Key Open Prices)

These are specific times of the day that institutional algorithms often reference. The model tracks:

* **00:00 (NY Midnight Open)**
* **08:30 (CME Open)**
* **09:30 (NY Stock Exchange Open)** Price often returns to retest these levels or uses them as a pivot for the daily bias.

### **Liquidity Grabs**

Often used interchangeably with **Sweeps**, a **Liquidity Grab** is when price aggressively moves into an area where many stop-loss orders are sitting (above highs or below lows). The intent is to "grab" the available liquidity to fuel a move in the opposite direction.

### **Projections**

Once a model is confirmed via **CISD**, the tool automatically plots **Projections** (or targets) on the chart. These are calculated levels (often 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 standard deviations of the manipulation range) where price is likely to gravitate towards during the Distribution phase.
