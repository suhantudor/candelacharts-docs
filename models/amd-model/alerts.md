# Alerts

Never miss a move with the AMD Model's comprehensive alert system. You can set up notifications to be sent to your phone, email, or webhook whenever a key market event occurs.

### Available Alerts

1. **Model Formed / CISD**
   * **Trigger:** Fires when a valid AMD model is confirmed by a **CISD (Change in State of Delivery)**.
   * **Why use it:** This is the highest-probability signal. It means the manipulation is likely over, and the real move is starting. It's your "look for entry" bell.
2. **HTF Candle Switch**
   * **Trigger:** Fires when the **Higher Timeframe (HTF)** candle changes color (e.g., from Bullish to Bearish).
   * **Why use it:** Great for trend followers. It alerts you that the higher-level trend might be shifting, prompting you to re-evaluate your bias.
3. **EQH / EQL Detected**
   * **Trigger:** Fires when **Equal Highs (EQH)** or **Equal Lows (EQL)** are detected on the chart.
   * **Why use it:** These levels act as magnets for price. Knowing where they are helps you identify potential targets or areas where price might reverse after a sweep.
