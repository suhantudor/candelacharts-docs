# Timeframe Mapping

One of the most powerful features of the AMD Model is its ability to map **Higher Timeframe (HTF)** structure onto your **Lower Timeframe (LTF)** entry chart.

However, not every pairing works well. You want a balance: enough detail on the LTF to see the structure form, but not so much noise that the HTF context gets lost.

Here are the **recommended pairings** to get the best results:

| If your LTF (Entry) is...   | Use this HTF (Context)...          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **15 seconds - 30 seconds** | **1 Hour (1H)**                    |
| **1 minute - 2 minutes**    | **4 Hours (4H)**                   |
| **3 minutes - 5 minutes**   | **8 Hours (8H)** or **Daily (1D)** |
| **15 minutes**              | **Weekly (1W)**                    |

#### Why these pairings?

* **The "Factor of 4-8":** Generally, multiplying your LTF by 60-120 gives a solid HTF candle to track.
* **Intraday Structure:** For day trading, mapping the **4H** candle onto a **1m** chart is a favorite among professionals. It lets you see the 4-hour candle build itself bar-by-bar.
* **Swing Trading:** Using the **Daily** or **Weekly** HTF on a **15m** chart helps you catch major market reversals.
