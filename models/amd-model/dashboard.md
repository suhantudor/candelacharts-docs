# Dashboard

The **AMD Dashboard** is your mission control center. It sits neatly on your chart, giving you a real-time snapshot of what the model is seeing without cluttering your view.

### Metrics at a Glance

The dashboard displays the following key information:

1. **Model Status:**
   * **Bullish:** Indicates the market structure supports upward movement.
   * **Bearish:** Indicates the market structure supports downward movement.
   * **No Model Yet:** Waiting for clear structure to form.
2. **Current Phase:**
   * Tells you if the market is currently in **Accumulation**, **Manipulation**, or **Distribution**. This helps you know _when_ to trade (e.g., avoid trading during accumulation, look for entries during manipulation/distribution).
3. **Sweep Detected:**
   * **Yes/No:** Instantly tells you if a liquidity sweep has occurred in the current setup. A "Yes" is a strong confluence factor.
4. **CISD Status:**
   * **Confirmed/Unconfirmed:** Lets you know if the change in delivery state has been validated. A confirmed CISD is often the "green light" for entry.
5. **Time Remaining:**
   * A countdown timer showing exactly how much time is left in the current **HTF candle**. This is crucial for timing your entries relative to the candle close.

### Customization

You can easily customize the dashboard to fit your screen:

* **Position:** Move it to any corner or center of the chart (Top/Bottom, Left/Right/Center).
* **Size:** Scale it from Tiny to Huge.
* **Visibility:** Toggle it on or off if you prefer a cleaner chart.
