### **Current Model**

### **Remaining Time Until HTF Candle Close**

A countdown shows how much time remains until the higher timeframe (HTF) candle closes. This is crucial for timing entries, exits, or validating model setups, particularly for traders focused on higher timeframes.

### **Sessions Filter**

This filter allows users to view trading data within specific market sessions (Killzones).

### **Model Status Filter**

This filter enables users to focus on specific states or conditions of the trading model.
