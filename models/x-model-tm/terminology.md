# Terminology

### **External Range Liquidity (ERL)**

ICT External Range Liquidity refers to the pools of liquidity located _outside_ the boundaries of a defined dealing range—specifically, above previous swing highs and below previous swing lows. These areas are typically targeted by price as they represent clusters of stop orders and resting liquidity.

### **Internal Range Liquidity (IRL)**

ICT Internal Range Liquidity is found _within_ the dealing range itself. This internal liquidity often aligns with institutional reference points, such as Fair Value Gaps (FVGs), or other imbalances, which can be used as potential entry points in a trade setup.

### Smart Money Technique (SMT)

ICT SMT (Smart Money Technique) Divergence occurs when two positively correlated assets, observed on the same timeframe, display conflicting market structures.

For example, while one asset forms a higher low, the other forms a lower low—indicating a divergence in strength between the two. A common instance of this can be seen between pairs like GBP/USD and EUR/USD, where such a discrepancy may signal potential market inefficiency or a forthcoming reversal.

### Change In State of Delivery (CISD)

Change in state of delivery (CISD) is based on the opening and closing price of a candlestick while the Market Structure Shift-MSS is based on the high and low of a candlestick.

### True Day Open (00:00)

In ICT (Inner Circle Trader) terminology, the "true day open" refers to the start of a new trading day, typically defined as 00:00 EST (Eastern Standard Time).
