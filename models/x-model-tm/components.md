# Components

The **X Model** in trading is a methodical approach that combines key market behaviors to identify promising trading opportunities.&#x20;

A prime example is the Market Maker X Model (MMXM), which focuses on analyzing price action, liquidity zones, and shifts in market structure to predict future price movements.

## Key Components

### **Previous Daily High/Low Run**

Determines if the previous day's high or low has been broken, signaling potential shifts in market direction.

### **15-Minute Market Structure Shift**

Examines changes in market structure on a 15-minute chart to confirm the trend direction established by the previous day's high/low breakout.

### **Smart Money Technique (SMT) Confirmation**

Utilizes SMT indicators to verify the market structure shift, ensuring alignment with institutional trading patterns.

### **1-Hour Fair Value Gap (FVG)**

Focuses on finding an optimal entry point by targeting the 1-hour Fair Value Gap, especially around the 50% level of the previous day's price range.

The X Model emphasizes the importance of understanding liquidity dynamics and price behavior to refine trading decisions.&#x20;

Many traders use tools such as the MMXM Indicator on MetaTrader platforms to automate the identification of these key zones and signals, streamlining their trading strategies.
