The X Model trading framework offers a structured approach for identifying high-probability trading opportunities by combining key technical indicators, market structure analysis, and timing strategies to guide both long and short entries.

### **Short Entry Checklist**

1. **Previous Day High (ERL):** Price breaks or tests the previous day’s high.
2. **H1 Bullish FVG (IRL):** A **Bullish FVG** on the 1-hour chart is present, indicating price rejection or a return to fill the gap.
3. **m15 MSS / SMT:** Confirm the bearish market structure on the 15-minute chart, supported by Smart Money confirmation (e.g., divergence, volume analysis).
4. **Above 00:00:** Only enter short trades **above 00:00** after the market’s daily reset.

### **Long Entry Checklist**

1. **Previous Day Low (ERL):** Price breaks or tests the previous day’s low, indicating a potential support level.
2. **H1 Bearish FVG (IRL):** A **Bearish FVG** on the 1-hour chart is present, signaling a potential retracement for a long opportunity.
3. **m15 MSS / SMT:** Confirm the bullish market structure on the 15-minute chart, supported by Smart Money confirmation (e.g., volume, divergence).
4. **Below 00:00:** Only enter long trades **below 00:00** before the market’s daily reset.

By following these rules, the X Model provides a structured approach for identifying high-probability entry points for both long and short trades.&#x20;

Traders can systematically use the **Previous Day High/Low**, **Fair Value Gaps**, **Market Structure Shifts**, and **Smart Money Technique** to confirm their entries, ensuring alignment with broader market trends and institutional activity.&#x20;

The added constraint of entering trades only **above or below 00:00** helps to focus on the optimal timing of market entries.
