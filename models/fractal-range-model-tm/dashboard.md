The dashboard is designed to display key data points, offering a comprehensive view of the current market conditions and the state of the chart.&#x20;

The following key metrics are displayed:

1. **Bias**: This section indicates the overall **market bias** based on the current model and time frame. It helps traders quickly assess whether the market is trending bullish, bearish, or neutral, providing a clear directional view. Understanding the market bias helps traders align their strategy with the prevailing market conditions.
2. **Current Model**: The dashboard highlights the **current model** that has been identified by the Fractal Range Model, such as a **Sweep** or **CISD** (Change In Structure Direction). This allows traders to instantly know which market structure is currently in play, helping them understand the underlying market dynamics and potential opportunities.
3. **Remaining Time Until HTF Candle Close**: The dashboard also displays a countdown showing the **remaining time until the higher time frame (HTF) candle closes**. This feature provides traders with valuable insight into the time left for the current candle to complete, helping them time entries, exits, or model validations more effectively. Itâ€™s particularly useful for those trading higher time frames and needing to make decisions based on the closure of key candles.
4. **Sessions Filter:** This filter allows users to view trading data within specific market sessions (Killzones).
5. **Model Status Filter:** This filter enables users to focus on specific states or conditions of the trading model.

The **FRM Dashboard** delivers a streamlined view of critical information, including the **market bias**, the **current model**, and the **remaining time until the HTF candle closes**.&#x20;

By consolidating these key data points, traders can make more informed decisions, enhancing their ability to navigate market conditions with greater confidence and precision.
