# Features

These features work together to turn raw price action into a repeatable plan. Each piece is modular, but the edge comes from using them together—**bias → context → trigger → management**—consistently across timeframes.

* **HTF Candles**
* **Mean (Equilibrium 0.5)**
* **C‑area**
* **Liquidity Levels**
* **Sweeps**
* **Double‑Purge Sweeps**
* **CISD**&#x20;
* **HTF PD Arrays**
* **LTF PD Arrays**
* **Projections**
* **SMT**
* **Autobias**
* **Realtime Models**
* **History**
* **Alerts**

Together, these features map bias, context, and execution into one consistent routine—so you can read the range, time the shift, and ride the expansion.
