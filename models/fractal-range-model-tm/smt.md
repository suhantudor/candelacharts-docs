# SMT

In the context of the **Fractal Range Model (FRM)**, the **SMT (Smart Money Technique)** serves as a crucial **confluence indicator** that strengthens the reliability of a formed model.&#x20;

When an SMT signal aligns with a model, it signifies a high level of confidence in the direction of the market, indicating a strong and likely sustained trend.

The **SMT** acts as a confirmation tool that validates the directional bias provided by the Fractal Range Model. It helps identify the involvement of **smart money** â€” the institutional and sophisticated market participants whose actions often drive significant market moves.&#x20;

When the SMT signal aligns with a specific model, such as a **Sweep** or **CISD** formation, it confirms the likelihood that the market will follow through in the indicated direction.

This confluence between the **Fractal Range Model** and **SMT** offers traders a more reliable and robust framework for predicting price action, providing clarity on which way the market is most likely to move.&#x20;

With the added confirmation from SMT, traders can confidently enter positions with a stronger conviction in the direction of the trend.

In summary, the **SMT** within the Fractal Range Model is a critical confluence factor that strengthens the directional signals of the model.&#x20;

When an SMT signal aligns with a formed market model, it confirms a clear market bias, indicating a strong probability of price movement in that direction.&#x20;

By leveraging this confluence, traders can make more informed, high-confidence decisions in their market entries and exits.
