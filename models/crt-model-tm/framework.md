# Framework

The **Candle Range Theory (CRT) Model** is an advanced trading framework designed to programmatically detect, visualize, and invalidate key market concepts such as **Sweeps**, **CISD** (Change In State of Delivery), **Projections**, **Liquidity**, and more.&#x20;

By integrating various components, this model provides a comprehensive view of the market, enabling traders to identify optimal entry and exit points.

## When to Enter a Trade

After the CRT Model completes its Formation phase and key components like Sweep and CISD are detected, traders should wait for additional technical signals before entering a trade. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of entry strategies:

### **1. Entry Using CISD**

The best entry signal comes from the CISD. When the CISD aligns with the model's structure, it acts as an entry point, suggesting the market will likely follow the predicted path.

* **Action**: Look for a CISD that aligns with the broader model and price structure.
* **Entry**: Enter near the CISD zone, setting a stop loss based on the model's invalidation rules.

### **2. Missed Entries: First C-Area Level**

If a trader misses the initial entry at the CISD or LTF PD Array, the next best entry opportunity comes at the first C-Area level. The C-Area represents a key zone where price action may consolidate. Traders should look for volume confirmation and ensure no divergences exist to validate the entry.

* **Action**: Wait for price to reach the first C-Area level, ensuring consolidation and strong volume.
* **Confirmation**: Check for the absence of divergences (e.g., no conflicting bullish or bearish divergences).
* **Entry**: If the above conditions are met, enter near the C-Area zone with a stop loss placed at the end of the zone.

By utilizing these entry strategies and leveraging the CRT Model's lifecycle phases, traders can better manage their trades, minimize risk, and enhance their decision-making process based on reliable market signals.
