# SMT

In the context of the Turtle Soup Model (TSM), the Smart Money Technique (SMT) serves as a crucial confluence indicator that enhances the reliability of a formed model. When an SMT signal aligns with a model, it signifies a high level of confidence in the market's direction, suggesting a strong and likely sustained trend.

The SMT acts as a confirmation tool, validating the directional bias indicated by the Turtle Soup Model. It helps identify the participation of smart moneyâ€”institutional and sophisticated market players whose actions often drive significant market movements.

When the SMT signal aligns with a specific model, such as a Sweep or Market Structure Shift (MSS) formation, it confirms the likelihood of the market continuing in the indicated direction.&#x20;

This confluence between the Turtle Soup Model and SMT provides traders with a more reliable and robust framework for predicting price action, offering greater clarity on the most probable market movement.

With the added confirmation from SMT, traders can enter positions with greater conviction, knowing that the market is likely to follow through in the projected direction.

In summary, the SMT within the Turtle Soup Model is a vital confluence factor that strengthens the directional signals of the model. When an SMT signal aligns with a formed market model, it solidifies a clear market bias, indicating a high probability of price movement in that direction.&#x20;

By leveraging this confluence, traders can make more informed, high-confidence decisions for both market entries and exits.
