# Standard Deviation

Once a model is formed, the Turtle Soup Model automatically generates standard deviation levels based exclusively on the wicks of the MSS High and MSS Low.&#x20;

By anchoring standard deviation to the wicks, the Turtle Soup Model captures the full range of price fluctuations, incorporating potential volatility and broader market movements.&#x20;

This approach provides traders with a more comprehensive understanding of the market’s potential behavior, highlighting areas where price could realistically move in the near term.

### Setup and Customization

The standard deviation levels can be customized to anchor to either the body or the wicks of the MSS High and MSS Low. However, in the context of the Turtle Soup Model, the wicks are specifically used to ensure a broader consideration of price volatility.&#x20;

This anchoring method accounts for the entire range of price movement, from the extremes of the wick, rather than just the body, thus providing a more complete picture of potential market behavior.

This flexibility allows traders to tailor standard deviations based on their individual risk profiles and trading strategies, making the model adaptable to different market conditions and trader preferences.

### Purpose and Application

The automatic standard deviations levels generated by the Turtle Soup Model are crucial for understanding the market’s potential after a model has formed.&#x20;

These standard deviations not only help identify possible price targets but also aid in assessing market behavior and making more informed trading decisions.

Whether for planning exits, managing risk, or evaluating price trends, these wick-based standard deviations are a core feature of the Turtle Soup Model, providing valuable insights into future price movements and assisting traders in executing strategies with greater confidence.
