# Standard Deviation

Once a model is formed, the Turtle Soup Model automatically generates standard deviation levels based exclusively on the wicks of the MSS High and MSS Low.&#x20;

By anchoring standard deviation to the wicks, the Turtle Soup Model captures the full range of price fluctuations, incorporating potential volatility and broader market movements.&#x20;

This approach provides traders with a more comprehensive understanding of the marketâ€™s potential behavior, highlighting areas where price could realistically move in the near term.

Whether for planning exits, managing risk, or evaluating price trends, these wick-based standard deviations are a core feature of the Turtle Soup Model, providing valuable insights into future price movements and assisting traders in executing strategies with greater confidence.
